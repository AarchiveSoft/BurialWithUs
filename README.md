##  Overview

BurialWithUs is an application tailored for automating plate armor crafting in a gaming environment. Its core functionality revolves around streamlining the crafting process by orchestrating movement, forging, crafting, upgrading, and conversion tasks based on predefined rules. The project encompasses a user interface component for configuring script settings, such as armor type selection and delay adjustments. By integrating natural delays and script control, BurialWithUs enhances the gaming experience through efficient automation of intricate crafting procedures.
